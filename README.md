# Spotify Playlist Auto-Generator Bot

This project automates the creation of Spotify playlists on Android by interpreting high-level intents (mood, genre, activity, seed artists) and performing human-like taps, searches, and saves inside the Spotify app. It removes the grind of manual curation, scales to many devices/accounts, and outputs consistently themed playlists. Built for agencies and growth teams, the Spotify Playlist Auto-Generator Bot keeps your curation pipeline fast, stealthy, and reliable.

##Introduction
The bot takes prompts like “chill evening lofi 60–90 BPM, no vocals” or “gym hip-hop + EDM 2 hours” and turns them into curated playlists by operating the Android Spotify app on real devices or emulators. It automates the repetitive workflow of keyword searches, artist/track exploration, like/save actions, and playlist assembly with scheduling and retries. Businesses gain speed, scale, and consistency—without exposing primary accounts.

### Automating Spotify Playlist Curation at Scale
- Converts natural-language intents into device actions that find, filter, and assemble high-quality playlists.
- Runs on real Android devices and emulator farms with proxy and fingerprint isolation for multi-account safety.
- Emulates human usage (typing, scroll jitter, dwell time, randomness) to reduce bot detection.
- Ships with dashboards, logging, and safe retry logic for resilient overnight runs.

## Core Features (must include 8–10)
- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Run on physical Android phones or emulator farms (Bluestacks/Nox). Device profiles, orientation control, and per-instance isolation for safer operations.
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Control devices over Wi-Fi using Appilot’s lightweight bridge and Accessibility services; ideal for locked-down environments where ADB is restricted.
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized delays, scroll variance, touch path curvature, and intermittent backtracks to simulate real users and minimize heuristics-based detection.
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Account pools with credential vaulting, session cookies, and per-account limits (daily creation caps, save caps) to protect reputation.
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Orchestrate 10–300+ devices with queues and worker pools; shard prompts across regions, proxies, or account tiers.
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Consistent, niche-aligned playlists drive follows and saves; pair with editorial prompts for compounding discovery.
- **Premium Support:** Priority SLA, guided onboarding, runbooks, and hands-on scaling assistance from the Appilot team.
- **Prompt-to-Playlist Engine:** Translate prompts (mood/genre/BPM/duration/seeds) into deterministic search plans and fallback heuristics.
- **Stealth & Proxy Layer:** Rotating residential/mobile proxies, per-device IP pinning, and optional DNS split to reduce correlation risks.
- **Scheduler & Guardrails:** Cron-like runs, cooldowns, per-account throttles, max error budgets, and circuit breakers for safe, unattended operation.

**Additional Capabilities**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Seed Artist/Track Expansion** | Start from seed artists/tracks and expand via “related” graphs, applying exclusion filters and diversity thresholds. |
| **BPM & Energy Heuristics** | Uses metadata hints and contextual keywords to approximate BPM/energy ranges when direct filters aren’t exposed in the app UI. |
| **Deduping & Freshness** | Avoids repeats across recent playlists, enforces freshness windows, and caps artist dominance. |
| **Template Prompts** | Reusable prompt templates (e.g., “Cafe Lofi 90m”, “Focus Ambient 2h”) with adjustable knobs (vocals, decades, language). |
| **Run Audits & Reports** | Exports JSON/CSV summaries: added tracks, skipped reasons, session timings, proxy fingerprints, and error counts. |
| **Role-Based Access** | Admin vs Operator roles, per-project keys, and redacted logs for safe outsourcing and team collaboration. |

## How It Works (must)
1. **Input or Trigger** — The automation is triggered through the Appilot dashboard, where the user defines prompts (mood/genre/BPM/duration/seeds), device counts, schedules, and account pools for Android devices/emulators.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot controls the Android device or emulator via UI Automator/Accessibility (or ADB where allowed), opens Spotify, runs searches, explores related artists/tracks, applies heuristics, and assembles a new playlist with human-like taps and scrolls.  
3. **Output or Action** — The bot creates/saves a playlist, adds curated tracks to reach target duration, optionally sets cover/description, and returns links plus a result report.  
4. **Other functionalities** — Built-in retry logic, structured logging, screenshots-on-error, anomaly flags, and parallel processing are configurable in the Appilot dashboard for resilience and fast troubleshooting.

## Tech Stack (must)
- **Language:** Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework, Cucumber  
- **Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, MonkeyRunner, Accessibility  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues, Real device farm

## Use Cases (must)
- **Music curators** use it to turn mood/genre briefs into publishable playlists, so they can deliver more themed sets per week with consistent quality.  
- **Marketing teams** use it to generate campaign-specific playlists per region/account, so they can accelerate branded content and community engagement.  
- **Agencies** use it to run multi-account curation at night across device farms, so they can scale deliverables without adding headcount.  
- **Developers** use it to test Spotify UI flows across devices, so they can validate heuristics and stability under load.

## FAQs
**How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?**  
Add accounts to the credential vault, assign per-account limits and proxy bindings in `settings.yaml`, then select the account pool in the dashboard run config. The scheduler fans out jobs across available devices with guardrails.

**Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?**  
Yes. Configure mobile/residential proxies with sticky sessions, enable per-device IP pinning, and turn on human-like gestures/delays. Optional device fingerprint rotation is available when paired with emulator templates.

**Can I schedule it to run periodically?**  
Yes. Use the built-in cron scheduler for daily/weekly runs. Set cooldowns, error budgets, and size caps per account or prompt template.

**What if Spotify UI changes?**  
Selectors are version-pinned and monitored. The bot ships with fallback strategies, visual anchors, and rapid patching via remote config to keep runs stable.

**Can it avoid explicit content or duplicates?**  
You can toggle explicit filters and enable dedupe across the last N playlists, with caps on artist dominance and decade skew.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks (must)
- **Execution Speed:** Handles **100+ UI actions/minute** per device in steady state with parallelized search/add flows.  
- **Success Rate:** **95%** successful playlist creation across 1,000+ sessions in mixed device farms.  
- **Scalability:** Horizontally scales to **300–1,000** Android devices with sharded queues and backpressure.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lightweight workers keep CPU under 35%/device on mid-tier hosts; memory stabilized via snapshot-based emulator reuse.  
- **Error Handling:** Exponential backoff, per-step retries, screenshot logging, anomaly tagging, and circuit breakers to pause noisy accounts or bad proxies.
